### Chapter 1, Project 3

Determine the distance traveled by a ball that bounces.
User input includes the starting height as well as how many bounces the ball takes.

An assumption made here is that the index of "bounciness" is .6
For example:
Dropped from 10 feet, the next bounce will go 6 feet in the air (10 x .6)
