### Fundamentals of Python: Data Structures

My results for various projects in the book [Fundamentals of Python: Data Structures](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Python-Structures-Kenneth-Lambert/dp/1285752007 "Fundamentals of Python: Data Structures - Kenneth Lambert")

I've completed these in Python 3.5, there are parts that won't work in Python 2.X
